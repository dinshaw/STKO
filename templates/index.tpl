At Stockton Outfitters, we take you back to a place which has remained timeless.  Back to the purity of nature where the trials and tribulations of modern society vanish with the brilliance of the setting sun.</p><p class="lg">There is no better way for a family, group of friends, or a corporate management team to get reacquainted. Daily activities include photographic tours, fishing, horseback riding, hiking, or simply reading a book.  Our camp is on the continental divide and our mountains are abundant with wildlife and wild flowers.</p><p class="lg">As with all of our adventures, we're a little western.  Join our guides for hours of cowboy poetry and western tales around the campfire. "Camp is just like Yellowstone Park without the rat race of people and bubbling mud pots."</p><p class="lg">Stockton Outfitters, LLC can customize a summer pack trip or day ride to accommodate any family outing or corporate function.</p><h1 class="right">Trip Details &amp; Information</h1><table id="details">	<tr>		<td><span>Location:</span> Region 3 - Area 319</td>		<td><span>Season:</span> July 1-Aug. 15</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td><span>Trip Duration:</span> 7 days</td>		<td><span>Availability:</span> Available</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td><span>Departs from:</span> Butte, Montana</td>		<td><span>Camp:</span> Ten-mile Cr.</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td><span>Accommodations:</span> Wall Tent</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td colspan="2"><span>Peaks & Passes:</span></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td colspan="2"><p>Nestled just outside the Pintlar Wilderness Area in Southwestern Montana, Stockton Outfitters' Ten Mile Camp is seated at an approximate 7,200 ft elevation.
